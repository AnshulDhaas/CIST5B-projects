Launching the Navigation System:
    - Navigate to main.py and make sure you have installed all dependencies, the project uses a package called TkinterMapView. Afterwards, run main.py.

Interacting with the Navigation System:
    - There are three load buttons, one for cars, intersections, and roads. For each load button, a file browsing menu will open and then you must attach the corresponding csv files that I have placed in the project folder.
    - After loading the data, you may interact with the other two buttons after selecting two intersections or points, to find the fastest route and simulate traffic.
    - The find fastest route will display the fastest route on the GUI menu's map and when simulating traffic the weights of the roads will be recalculated.
    - You may simulate traffic infinitely, but it may stop after all cars reach their destinations.
    - To stop the program you may exit out of the window and quit the GUI.
